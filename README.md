### FRONTEND MENTOR | MAKER PRE LAUNCH LANDING PAGE

### | Description | ###

Maker Pre Launch Landing Page @ Frontend Mentor.

Frontend Mentor url: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/maker-prelaunch-landing-page-WVZIJtKLd

A landing page with build with React Components.

Made use of FIGMA files to build up my HTML file with classes and id's.
You can make use of their styleguide and create UTILITIES + VARIABLES fromt it. This gives an efficient workflow to your work.

Afterwards I've made it responsive with flexbox and media querries.

### | My Final Solution | ###

Toolbox: HTML + CSS + Javascript + React

### | Evaluation | ###

Learned new ways in this project to build something up from scratch and start with React/NextJS to create components and having their own css modules. 
Working with components gives you a the power and control to edit every element by its own.

Working with components are an great lifesafer to speed up my workflow and to keep my code clean!

My next project will be an another one from Frontend Mentor, which I will starat in a reverse order, from mobile to desktop, so the responsive tweaks will go much easier! 

Happy coding!
